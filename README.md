# Embedded Intelligence Labs IL2233
The course covers selected statistical,machine, and deep learning
methods for realizing relevant functionalities (e.g. feature exaction, time-series
forecasting, clustering, and anomaly detection, etc.) desired in embedded systems.
The course focuses more on applied time-series analysis techniques, touching upon
both statistical and deep learning approaches, and their application in embedded
systems.

## Lab 0
Build and Train an MLP (Multi-layer perceptron) model, and a polynomial
regression model, which realizes the sine function y(t)=sin(t). Given a value t, it can
predict the value y(t)

## Lab 1
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis using white noise series, random walker series, Global land temperature anomalies series
 2. Feature extraction of features from a synthetic signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) time-series data

## Lab 2
1. Find the invertibility, stationarity, ACF, PACF of AR, MA, ARMA models
2. ARIMA modeling and predictions
3. Series transformations

## Lab3 
1.  Implement and evaluate K-means and SOM
2.  Application of K-means and SOM for clustering
3.  Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

## Final Project
